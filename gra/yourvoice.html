<p>Everything we do at Gendered Intelligence is informed by the young trans, non-binary and gender diverse people who we support. It’s really important for us to get this right, and to get it right we need to know what you’re thinking about these changes to the Gender Recognition Act that are being discussed.</p>

<h2>Change is a-comin’…</h2>

<p>How might proposed changes affect you, for the better or worse? What would you like to see the Gender Recognition Act to look like in an ideal world, and how do we get there?</p>

<p>Please tell us below and Gendered Intelligence will try to reflect your voice in our consultation response. Even if we can’t use your response this time, it’s still very important for us to know what you’re thinking about the process, what is and isn’t working and what needs change, for our future work.</p>
