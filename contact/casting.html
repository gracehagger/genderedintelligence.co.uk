<h2>Are you looking for a trans or non-binary actor?</h2>

<p>Gendered Intelligence can share your casting call.</p>

<p>From 2015-19, Gendered Intelligence ran TransActing, a project that delivered a range of acting training and industry workshops to trans, non-binary and gender diverse actors aged 16+.</p>

<p>You can find out more about TransActing alumni <a href="http://transacting.co.uk/alumni.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>As a result of this project, we run a Facebook group for all trans actors in our network and we are happy to share casting calls with the group.</p>

<p>If you would like us to share a casting call, please consider that we will be sharing it as a Facebook post. Therefore it would be extremely useful if you could send a short text to share that highlights:</p>

<ul>
<li>The role being advertised and requirements for it</li>
<li>If the role is paid, and what the fee is</li>
<li>When and where auditions are taking place</li>
<li>When the project itself is taking place </li>
</ul>

<p>Please email all casting calls and any questions to <a href="mailto:admin@genderedintelligence.co.uk">admin@genderedintelligence.co.uk</a></p>

<p></body></p>
