<h2>Trans Youth Camp <br></h2>

<p>Since 2010, we've taken young trans people on a weekend camping trip: an annual opportunity to take part in lots of fun activities and spend time with other young trans and non-binary people.</p>

<p>Information about this year's camping trip can be found <a href="../camping.html"><strong>HERE</strong></a>.</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p><strong>What the young trans people thought about our camping trip:</strong> <br></p>

<p>"<em>I learnt a lot and had so much fun for the first time in a long time. I didn't want to leave, it was like a little piece of paradise. I can't wait until the next one!</em>" - Youth group member  <br> <br>
"<em>Camp was a place I could be myself, a place where I didn’t worry about gender or the world outside, a place to forget about my problems for 4 days</em>" - Youth group member  <br> <br>
"<em>I really enjoyed archery, but what I liked best was just hanging out and chatting by the camp fire each night</em>." - Youth group member  <br><br>
"<em>It was muddy, but still fantastic</em>!" - Youth group member  <br><br>
"<em>I wish every day was camp!</em>" - Youth group member  <br><br>
"<em>I made some really good friends on camp and now feel less alone in the world.</em>” - Youth group member <br> <br></p>
