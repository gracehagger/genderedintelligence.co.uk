<h2>Resources for Young Trans People</h2>

<p>Gendered Intelligence has produced a number of resources by and for trans young people and gender questioning young people in the UK and beyond. You can view them as PDFs for free.</p>

<h2>'Free To Be Me' E-Zine</h2>

<p><a href="../zine/index.html"><img src="http://cdn0.genderedintelligence.co.uk/2012/11/17/17-16-50-tumblr_m2vyi73PXK1qgha0vo1_500 (1).jpg" width="200" height="400"></a></p>

<p>The "Free to be me" project looked to introduce the topic of Hate Crime to our young members, and looked at knowing one's rights. It was carried out in collaboration with Galop. Galop is an anti-violence charity that works in London with everyone who has experienced homophobia, transphobia and biphobia, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity. They also work with people who have experienced any violence, safety issues or problems with the police, but would prefer to talk to a lesbian, gay, bi, trans, or queer community organisation about it. The message of the project was "If it feels wrong, then it is wrong".</p>

<h2>Knowledge is Power</h2>

<p><img src="http://cdn0.genderedintelligence.co.uk/2015/08/14/12-56-52-knowledge is power bannere.png"></p>

<p>Knowledge is Power is a project funded by Awards for All. It gathered knowledge generated through a series of youth sessions, as well as research and writing carried out by a diverse team of GI community members.</p>

<p>At Gendered Intelligence we think knowledge is not the same as information. Knowledge is something that comes from within. Knowledge comes when an individual has received information but has processed it in a way that offers meaning to their life.</p>

<p>Our Knowledge is Power project will provide you with lots of information but it’s up to you to convert that into knowledge.</p>

<p>If you do this we think that you will be empowered to make decisions that will enrich your life.</p>

<p>Kapow!</p>

<p>Alongside the information on our website we encourage you to look on other websites, visit libraries, talk to people, watch films, TV programmes and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/" <Youtube></a> videos so that you can form your own views. We have linked to lots of other sites too and offered signposts where we can.</p>

<p>Converting information into knowledge is about learning about the world around us and about who we are. It’s also about changing ourselves and the world for the better! Sharing our own knowledge with others is about ensuring that knowledge circulates and benefits the whole of society.</p>
