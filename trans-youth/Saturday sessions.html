					<h2>Community Saturdays in London</h2>

<p><strong>Please note, in light of the current situation and until further notice, all GI youth groups and youth service events will be held online.</strong></p>

<p>In 2021, we will be running our Under 12s group and our group for 11-25 year olds on different Saturdays.</p>

<p>Our under 12s group will now take place on the 3rd Saturday of the month.</p>

<p>Our group for 11-25 year olds will continue to take place on the last Saturday of the month.</p>

<p>There are a few exceptions to this schedule – Pride in London, Trans Pride in Brighton, August as our summer picnic often falls on a different date, and our End of Year Showcase in December.</p>

<h2>Who can come to our Saturday Sessions?</h2>

<p>No matter how you identify, Gendered Intelligence's trans youth groups are open to all young trans people between 11 - 25 years (if you have a trans child who is under 8, please contact us for more information and support) - whether you're brand new to identifying as trans, or gender variant, still questioning your identity, or if you consider yourself to be post-transition or as having a trans history.</p>

<p>We strive to be fully inclusive of individuals who identify as non-binary, as well as male or female.</p>

<p>You do not have to be accompanied by a parent or carer, however if you are under 18, a youth worker will need to take the contact details of a next of kin in case of emergencies.  There is no need to register in advance - just turn up on the day.</p>

<p>Siblings of young trans people who are between 11 - 25 are also welcome to these sessions.</p>

<p><strong>Parents/carers</strong></p>

<p>Parents/carers of young trans, gender variant and questioning young people are welcome to come along to our parents and carers' group at Saturday sessions. You do not have to be accompanied by a young person to attend.</p>

<p>If you would like to return to the group after your first session, we would ask you to become a <a href="../families/group.html">parent/carer member</a></p>
