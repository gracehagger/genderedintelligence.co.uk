		<p>We are keen to know what difference we have made to young people in the past year. The information we gather will be used for our report to Children in Need (current funders for the group sessions) as well as to seek further funding for the youth groups.&#x00a0;</p><p>You must have attended a youth group (Bristol, Leeds, BAME, Saturday, 16-25 and under 16s) session since March 2015.&#x00a0;</p><p><b>Click here for the survey: <a href="http://genderedintelligence.us2.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=990a23c55fc0cfe9defa57828&amp;id=3a5e2a4e1f&amp;e=ca38b86e31" target="_blank">http://goo.gl/forms/rKu5MCeCgK</a>&#x00a0;</b></p><p>It&rsquo;s not a long form - could take anything from 5 - 20 minutes of your time. Some answers are required but most are optional so don&rsquo;t feel you have to say something in every box.&#x00a0;</p><p>If you can also spread the word amongst other attendees of the youth groups, it would really help.
