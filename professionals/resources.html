<h2>Downloadable toilet signs</h2>

<p>Gendered Intelligence provides signs which you can download, print and use as temporary signage for toilets.</p>

<p>These signs can be used when you are hiring an external venue and want to set a higher standard of inclusivity for the toilets. Using these signs can also be a good way to start a conversation with venues about their facilities and promote trans inclusive practice.</p>

<h2>Football Association: A Guide to Including Trans People in Football</h2>

<p><img src="http://cdn0.genderedintelligence.co.uk/2016/09/13/09-44-16-FA.JPG" height="100px" width="200px">

<br>
In 2015 Gendered Intelligence worked closely with the <a href="http://www.thefa.com/">Football Association</a> on their guide to including trans people in football.</p>

<p>The new guidance is based on the FA’s core ethos that <strong>football is for everyone</strong>.</p>

<p>The guide covers:</p>

<ul>
<li>Terminology</li>
<li>Laws that protect trans people</li>
<li>How to tackle discrimination at your club</li>
<li>Making positive steps towards inclusion</li>
<li>Issues around ‘fairness of competition’</li>
<li>Supporting trans people as managers, players, supporters and other football roles</li>
<li>Testimonies from trans people who play, watch and coach football</li>
</ul>

<p><br></p>

<form action="http://cdn0.genderedintelligence.co.uk/2016/09/13/09-50-06-transpeople-in-football-guide.pdf"><button type="submit" class="btn btn-large btn-inverse">PDF version</button>
</form>

<p><br></p>

<p>To accompany the guidance, Gendered Intelligence has produced a short film about trans people playing football. We hope the video will lead to greater understanding for people who play football and are involved in football at semi-professional and grass-roots levels.</p>

<p><strong>Watch the film</strong></p>
