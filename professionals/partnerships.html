<p>In order to improve the lives of trans people we need to make the world more intelligent about gender. This is a big project - to achieve our ambitions we work in partnership with major organisations that engage the general public. Together we get the message out there that gender diversity is good for everyone.</p>

<p>We're passionate about working with organisations that work in creative and cultural spaces – this is not just TV and newspapers, but also museums, galleries, theatres. Media, culture and sports are a key focus for us in ensuring that society is inclusive of trans people.</p>

<h2>Football Association</h2>

<p><img src="http://cdn0.genderedintelligence.co.uk/2015/11/20/14-41-03-Football Association (500x252).jpg" align=left vspace="20" hspace="20")></p>

<p>We worked with the <a href="http://www.thefa.com/">Football Association</a> to support them with their trans inclusion policies and guidance. Gendered Intelligence was been commissioned by the <a href="http://www.thefa.com/">Football Association</a> to develop guidance around the practical inclusion of all trans people in football.</p>

<p>The guidance aims to support of the FA’s <strong>Trans People in Football</strong> policy. The guidance will foreground the ethos of the FA – which is that football is for everyone. It is friendly and easy to read and is for anyone who wishes to know more about trans people participating in football.</p>

<p>In February 2015 Gendered Intelligence worked with 17 members of the trans community through delivering two Trans Inclusion in Football workshops in London and Leeds. The members, who were between the ages of 10 and 59 and from different sections of the community, came together to think about including trans people who take part in football. We heard from people who have participated in football in different ways – as players, coaches, match officials and on the terraces. We also heard from those who have stopped participating in football as well as from those who want to get involved but have their reservations.</p>

<p>The workshop aimed to offer an opportunity to contribute to trans inclusion in our national game at all levels, via the biggest sporting body in the country. We did this by gathering some real life experiences of trans people who participate in football.</p>

<p>No doubt there are barriers for trans people in the footballing world and indeed other sports too. In general there is not enough knowledge of what it means to be trans and there are a lot of myths that need busting! The guidance is there to educate people, to break down stereotypes and cultural assumptions. As part of this project we want to ensure coaches, players, referees and fans know that it’s okay to be trans and that we have trans people within our footballing communities.</p>

<p><br><br>The <a href="http://www.cssd.ac.uk/news/transgender-acting">TransActing project</a> explores the issue of performer training for people who identify as trans and/ or non-binary.
