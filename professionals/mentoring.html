<h2>Mentoring for trans, non-binary, gender diverse and questioning students</h2>

<p>Gendered Intelligence offers mentoring to trans, non-binary or gender diverse identified students, as well as to those who are questioning their gender identity or who have a trans history. Mentoring takes place in any educational setting. The mentoring scheme aims to retain the student in the institute of education, where retention and attainment may be at risk. The mentoring scheme is delivered primarily via one to one meetings that offer practical support and take a problem-solving approach. All our mentors are trans and/or non-binary identified and have professional skills in working with young people. It allows us to explore feelings and needs around a young person’s gender identity. The service is flexible and considers the specific circumstances of the young person. Currently, due to COVID, we are delivering mentoring sessions remotely. For more information about this, please contact <a href="mailto:education@genderedintelligence.co.uk">education@genderedintelligence.co.uk</a>.</p>

<p>The mentoring scheme offers an opportunity to:</p>

<ul>
<li>explore feelings and needs around the student’s gender identity including social transition</li>
<li>discuss some of the more difficult and challenging aspects of living as a trans/gender variant person</li>
<li>access relevant information so that each trans person can make informed choices about their lives</li>
<li>advocate for the student’s needs within their educational setting</li>
</ul>

<strong>What educational institutions and students think of our mentoring packages</strong></p>

<p>“Working with GI has meant that the transgender student has continued to engage in college life and complete a course of study. The student was really struggling with college life when the mentoring was first put in place” -
<em><strong>Director of Studies, Hereford Sixth Form College</strong></em></p>

<p>“I suppose with my own personal identity support from GI has made me feel more secure. Before I might have thought that being trans is something to keep to myself but now I feel much more comfortable knowing that someone else knows who I am rather than not. Also, I notice how it’s now easier to accept my own identity as much as others do. If I know everyone’s fine with me for who I am it makes my identity less of a weight on my shoulders and just another thing about me which makes me who I am” - <em><strong>Trans Student</strong></em></p>

<p>“I definitely feel more confident after mentoring. For me I really didn’t know so well how to talk about gender identity with other people, it was all a bit too awkward so I avoided it. It helps so much to be able to have open conversations about something so important and I feel much freer and much closer to friends and family because of it. The mentoring scheme at GI was really my only source of actual practical help with stuff like how to deal with relationships with others. When you first come to terms with being trans it is definitely a daunting prospect and it feels like a million things are flying at you at once, so it really helped to have support with specific challenges I faced individually”- <em><strong>Trans Student</strong></em></p>
