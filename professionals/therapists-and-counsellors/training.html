<h2>Working Alongside Trans, Gender Diverse and Questioning People</h2>

<p><b>A two-day training course for therapists and counsellors</b></p>

<h2>About the Course</h2>

<p>This two-day course has been created in response to demand for more in-depth and specialist learning from therapists and counsellors themselves, and to the need of the wider trans community for a pool of trans-knowledgeable therapists and counsellors to draw on.</p>

<p>The training is a mix of formal presentations, interactive exercises and reflective discussions delivered in a small group learning environment by two professional trainers who combine extensive therapeutic and trans-specific knowledge and practice.<br><br></p>

<p>(Bursaries are available - see 'Requesting a Place' below)</p>

<p><br></p>

<p><strong>For:</strong></p>

<p>This course is for practising psychotherapists, therapists and counsellors, working in the fields of talking therapies (as opposed to physical therapies).</p>

<p>You may already be working alongside people who might be described as gender variant, gender non-conforming or gender dysphoric in clinical settings, but who might describe themselves with a very wide variety of different terms including trans, transgender, a person with a trans history, non-binary, gender questioning, gender expansive, genderqueer, gender fluid or agender, or who otherwise have an experience of gender that doesn’t align with society’s expectations in some way.</p>

<p>The course is also for those interested in beginning work alongside gender diverse people.</p>

<p>We particularly welcome bookings from QTIPOC / trans therapists and counsellors.</p>

<p><br></p>

<p><strong>Numbers:</strong> Maximum of 12 participants to ensure individual learning needs are met, and to allow for social distancing within the venue.</p>

<p><br>
<strong>This session is also available as an in-house course.</strong> <u><a href="mailto:training@genderedintelligence.co.uk">Contact us</a></u> for details<br></p>

<h2>Course Outline</h2>

<p>This two-day course will cover:</p>

<ul>
<li>Gender diversity in the current social context</li>
<li>A basic introduction to relevant legislation, including The Equality Act 2010, and how it might relate to service provision</li>
<li>The WPATH (The world Professional Association for Transgender Health) Standards of care for the Health of Transsexual, Transgender, and Gender Nonconforming People and how they inform good practice</li>
<li>The treatment pathways and medical contexts relevant to transgender people and their families</li>
<li>Specific terminology, skills and knowledge relating to the use of language when working alongside trans and gender variant people</li>
<li>Gender Theory and how it can inform good practice in therapeutic work with trans people and their families</li>
<li>Theoretical models and psychotherapy practices that support work with trans and gender diverse people</li>
<li>Current dilemmas in practice with transgender and gender diverse people</li>
</ul>

<p><br>
The course takes a generic / integrative approach, providing useful tools to take back into your way of working.</p>

<p>Some elements are drawn from Gendered Intelligence's core half-day general course "Introduction to Trans Awareness".  If you have previously attended that course, you'll find a few of the exercises on the first day familiar.</p>

<h2>Learning Objectives</h2>

<li>Understand key terms and language, and have strategies to approach their continuing evolution</li>
<li>Understand the legal and medical contexts for working with trans clients</li>

<h2>Quotes from Previous Participants</h2>

<p>Here are just a few comments from previous delegates:</p>

<p>“Thank you so much for an amazing two days. I have thoroughly enjoyed the experience - not just at a learning level, but also the wonderful energies you've brought with you.  This is an area I want to specialise in and I feel much more confident now.  I loved the level of interaction and the pace and the fact there was time for reflection between exercises.  Amanda and Lee, you co-work with total fluidity - you're brilliant.  All done in such a gentle yet informative way.” Marilyn Carre, session participant, Jersey course</p>

<p>“One of the best short courses I have done in a long time.  Structure very well organised, thoughtful and good mix of presentations / discussion / trans experience / reflection / info etc.  Non judgmental, but effective challenging.   Excellent delivery of programme.  Good co-ordination between presenters.  Rich material.  Excellent booklet with info and exercises.  Well designed.” Gail Simon, Counselling Supervisor, Manchester course</p>

<p>“Very open, interesting, informative discussions with widely diverse group of therapists and backgrounds.  Lived experience was invaluable.” Annabelle Morrison, Clinical Psychologist, CAMHS</p>

<p>“I loved all of it, especially the variety of activities.  It was great!  Great pace, space to debrief and lots of individual activities to help process and reflect.  [The second day] was so hands on and useful, especially the role play and explaining theories of gender.  This was such a strong course with fabulous trainers.  I feel so much more prepared to have conversations with colleagues/friends around gender identity and how to work with gender variant people.  Wish it was 3 days! :-)” Shannon Leoni, High School Social and Emotional Counselor (Belgium)</p>
