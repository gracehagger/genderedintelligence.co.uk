<h2>Round-up 17th September</h2>

<p>From time to time, even the Trans Lobby™ needs to take a few duvet days and recharge the batteries. As of today, we’re all back in the office and there has been some very exciting goings-on the past few days.</p>

<li><strong><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamiewareham/2020/09/16/non-binary-people-protected-by-equality-act-in-landmark-ruling-against-jaguar-land-rover/#569704f079be">Genderfluidity and/or non-binary identity is covered under the ‘gender reassignment’ protected characteristic of the Equality Act</a></strong>, per a recent employment tribunal. Whilst the first of its kind by way of case law, this could be a ground-breaking precedent and mean that, for the first time, there is explicit protection for non-binary people from discrimination.
<br></li>
<li><strong>The BMA (British Medical Association) has <a href="https://www.bma.org.uk/news-and-opinion/push-for-progress-on-transgender-rights-in-healthcare">debated their role</a> in trans people’s right to self-determination and come to the conclusion that there shouldn’t be one</strong>! One GP said “as doctors, we should take no part in such a process”. From the BMA there is an overwhelming backing of self-identification, affirmation that trans people need and should have gender-appropriate healthcare, and that under-18s need the same. Good news all round!
<br></li>
<li>During the past few years, we will all have witnessed the same uptick in trans-hostile hit pieces across the British media. Against the backdrop of this, the <strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/sep/11/meet-the-trans-key-workers-treating-teaching-and-serving-the-uk">Guardian ran an article</a> on trans key workers during the ongoing pandemic</strong>.
<br></li>
<li><strong>London Trans Pride</strong> happened on Saturday – and what a balm it must’ve been for everyone there. There’s some background information to the <a href="https://www.vogue.co.uk/arts-and-lifestyle/article/gender-recognition-act-reforms">Why here</a> and Overwhelming grace and beauty in this photo journal of the day from <strong><a href="https://www.vogue.co.uk/arts-and-lifestyle/gallery/london-trans-pride-march">Vogue</a></strong>.
<br></li>
<li>The Trades Union Congress, with 5.5 million members, came out for trans rights while condemning LGB Alliance. Read more on <strong><a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2020/09/17/trades-union-congress-tuc-trans-non-binary-rights-lgb-alliance-transphobia/">PinkNews</a>.</strong></li>
