<h2>Capturing Journeys Report</h2>

<p>The Capturing Journeys and Setting Goals Project is a needs assessment tool, which was carried out with 40 young trans people from across England in 2010 and 2011. It involved a series of one to one interviews that were carried out by our staff at regular intervals throughout the project. This was done in order to capture current and recent experiences of young trans people; to identify any needs; to discuss overarching visions of their lives and to set goals in order that they can take their life forward. The interviews focused on a young person's life in the areas of health, social world (including housing and community), learning world and employment as well as seeking to analyse the lived experiences of young trans people from across England.</p>

<h2>Gendered Intelligence Biennial Report 2009-2011</h2>

<p>Over the last two years Gendered Intelligence has gone from strength to strength working with more young trans people, carrying out more activities and arts based projects, building more resources and delivering more workshops and trans awareness training. This Biennial Report offers a chance to tell you our story of what has been happening at Gendered Intelligence over the last two years.</p>

<h2>Trans Youth Support Work Report 2009 - 2011</h2>

<p>The Gendered Intelligence youth group was set up in February 2009 beginning with a four-week consultation with its members. In 2010 Gendered Intelligence was funded by the Equality &amp; Human Rights Commission (EHRC) to carry out a Trans Youth Support Work Project. Our Trans Youth Support Work project's key aim was to increase the visibility and quality of young transgendered people's life experiences from across England, who typically suffer inequality and disadvantage by implementing a greater choice, control and empowerment over their lives.</p>
