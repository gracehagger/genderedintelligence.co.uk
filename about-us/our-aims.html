<h2>About Gendered Intelligence</h2>

<p>Gendered Intelligence, established in 2008, is a registered charity that works to increase understandings of gender diversity and improve the lives of trans people.</p>

<p>Our vision is of a world where diverse gender expressions are visible and valued and where trans, non-binary, gender diverse and gender questioning people live healthy, safe and fulfilled lives.</p>

<p>We are a trans-led and trans-involving grass roots organisation with a wealth of lived experience, community connections of many kinds, and a depth and breadth of trans community knowledge that is second to none. The team has a variety of professional and academic specialisms and qualifications including training and facilitation, youth work, policy, the arts, and doctorates in trans related studies.</p>

<p>We aim to be thought leaders in this field, bringing positivity, passion and professionalism to everything we do, which, with our open and non-judgmental approach, enable nuanced discussion.</p>

<p><center><strong>We believe everyone can be intelligent about gender!</strong></center></p>

<h2>About our work</h2>

<p>We have three key departments at Gendered Intelligence. These are:

<br><br></b>
One of our great strengths is connecting between all these strands of work, combining learning, knowledge and expertise, making us more than the sum of our parts.</p>

<p>For example, understandings developed from our youth work and our professional training and consultancy work feed into our public engagement work; our public engagement work informs the ‘future proofing’ activities we can suggest to consultancy clients; our youth work learning helps shape our offer for educators and for organisations recruiting the next generation.</p>

<h2>Professional and Educational Services</h2>

<h2>Public Engagement</h2>

<p><a href="../services/publicengagement.html">Public Engagement</a> covers our work in the policy and media spheres, responding to consultations, requests for interviews and expert opinion; media engagement; engaging our supporters and others who may be interested in our work; and research.</p>

<p>For examples of our commentary visit our <a href="https://genderedintelligence.wordpress.com/">blog</a></p>

<h2>Our Philosophy</h2>

<p>Our identity as a man or a woman is often taken for granted, but sex and gender come about through a combination of biological, social and psychological aspects of life that build our individual identity. When we begin to investigate who we are, locating why we are the gender we feel ourselves to be, things can become very complex.</p>

<p>Gendered Intelligence might be a sensitivity or attunement to moments when gender or gendered expressions appear in the world in ways that raise interest or cause for debate. This might be a political moment where power is brought into play. If you think about what happens when certain behaviours which are traditionally carried out by one gender, are lived by an other, you can see quickly how roles, jobs, appearances and behaviours, even ways of thinking, are all gendered activities.</p>

<p>Therefore we might say that gender is not something that you are, or have, but is something that you do. For us, it is important to nurture and develop gendered intelligence in the individual, in order that we may occupy a world where a greater freedom of expression and a wider and richer spectrum of identities can co-exist.</p>

<p><br>Co-founder Jay Stewart delivered a TedX talk to make these points.
