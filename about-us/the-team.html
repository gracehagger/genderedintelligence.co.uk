<h2>The Gendered Intelligence Team</h2>

<p>Gendered Intelligence is made up of a host of highly skilled freelance workers who are facilitators, practitioners, youth workers, mentors, writers, researchers, trainers, educators, artists and designers, cultural commentator, social media-ites and all round talented folk.  The team at GI is growing and no doubt will grow more over the coming years.</p>

<p>The Gendered Intelligence team is made up of staff members across our four core 'areas of service', as well as our Central Support and Special Projects colleagues. Some members of the team work across the areas of service - we believe that people's strengths may not necessarily lie just in one area.</p>

<h2>Areas of Service</h2>

<p>Our key areas of service are:</p>

Jay has been involved in the trans community since 2002. Since then, he’s been passionate about improving the lives of trans and gender questioning people, especially young people. In 2008, Jay co-founded Gendered Intelligence and have been involved in delivering all aspects of GI’s work at one time or another, including projects such as ‘What makes your gender? Hacking into the Science Museum’ – a £10,000 Heritage Lottery funded project in partnership with the Science Museum, and ‘GI’s Anatomy: a life drawing project for trans and intersex people’ – a £30,000 project funded by the Welcome Trust.

In recent years he acted as an independent adviser to the Ministry of Justice review into the care and management of transgender offenders, and gave oral evidence to the Trans Inquiry for the Women and Equalities Select Committee. He now sits on the National Transgender Advisory Board for trans prisoners with the Ministry of Justice. He’s very enthusiastic about education and learning; his favourite subject is gender – there’s always more to discover.  In 2013 Jay gained his doctorate and has a range of publications in the area of Trans Studies.

Isa is a youth worker and mentor who has been working with GI since 2017. She uses words such as genderqueer, transfeminine, woman and trans to describe her gender. They facilitate youth groups for 7-11 year olds, 11-15 year olds, transfeminine young people (13-25) as well as monthly Community Saturdays. She also provides one-to-one mentoring in educational settings, does admin for the Youth Department and occasionally works at the helpline. Outside GI, when not baking, gardening or hanging upside down on a pole, Isa is training to become a counsellor. They are passionate about transfeminism, queer politics and building collective power and solidarity together through various community-led projects. Previously she has been involved in activism related to mental health, prisons and trans healthcare. As a youth worker and mentor Isa aims to create spaces where young trans people can really be heard, working with whatever they bring to the room. Listening to young people’s voices is really important to them, finding solutions together as groups and as individuals. The approach can be silly or serious, mixing games, discussions, workshops, arts and crafts or just chatting and having a laugh.

Since then, he has been a regular at parent groups in real life, a stall-holder at teacher conferences, university freshers’ weeks, NHS and college events, at London Pride and at Brighton Trans Pride. Currently he’s facilitating our online par nt and carer groups, from where, empowered by mutual support, information and laughter, families can better walk with the young people on their journey.

Chryssy has a research background in equality and diversity. Her research has focused on the impact of the Equality Act 2010 on the lives of the most marginalised, centring the lives of trans and sexgender nonconforming people, and drawing on her own lived experience as a trans woman. Chryssy brings this experience to her work with GI and the Board.  Chryssy is also active in work with LGBTQ+ prisoners with the Bent Bars Project, and helped set up TAGS for trans and sexgender nonconforming swimmers.
<br><br>

Chryssy facilitated a workshop on prison abolition at the GI Supercamp and gave a paper at the Transforming Spaces Conference about the politics of trans prisoners.  Outside of GI Chryssy works in the LGBTQ charity sector for Opening Doors London, helping over 50s in our communities overcome isolation and loneliness.  Chryssy has been involved with colleagues Mijke Van Der Drift and Nat Raha in promoting an academic and activist position of Radical Transfeminism, which was inaugurated at the London Conference of Critical Theory in 2015 and the first International Transgender Studies Conference in Tucson, Arizona in 2016.
<br><br>
Chryssy was born in Hull a long time ago and has worked and lived in lots of interesting and sometimes challenging environments, such as the two years she spent in Pyongyang a decade ago. Chryssy feels that living overseas on three continents for 10 years has given her some appreciation of the lives of others and a different perspective on the privileges and challenges of our lives in the UK, especially as a trans woman in these uncertain and seemingly disenfranchised times.Chryssy is also a proud parent.
