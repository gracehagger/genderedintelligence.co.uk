<h2>Bodily Autonomy for Every Body (BÆB)</h2>

<p>Our new BÆB campaign (pronounced "babe") is all about making sure that all young people ⁠— including but not limited to ⁠young trans people ⁠— have their enshrined right to bodily autonomy held up. <center></p>

<h2>What is bodily autonomy?</h2>

<p>Bodily autonomy ⁠or integrity is a fundamental human right and central feminist principle, meaning that each human being has control and ownership over their own bodies.</p>

<p>The law around the decisions young people can make about their bodies is clear: Gillick competence allows for those under 16 years of age to consent to medical treatment where they have a clear understanding and can give informed consent.<br><br></p>

<h2>Why did we create BÆB?</h2>

<p>There is an orchestrated, international effort underway to roll back the human right of young and/or trans people to make decisions for themselves. From off-the-cuff remarks from Ministers (<a href="baeb.html#minister">below</a>) in the UK to the <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/04/03/hungary-seeks-ban-legal-gender-recognition-transgender-people"> regressive laws</a> recently passed in Hungary, decisions which seek to remove autonomy from trans people around their own lives are taking a stranglehold over our cherished institutions.</p>

<p><strong>Simply put, we won't allow it to happen. And we know you feel the same.</strong> <br><br></p>
