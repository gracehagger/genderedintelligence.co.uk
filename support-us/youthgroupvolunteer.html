<h2>Could you help out at a GI youth group?</h2>

<p>At Gendered Intelligence, our youth groups are growing every month. We’re looking for enthusiastic <strong>trans-identified</strong> volunteers to work alongside our youth group leaders to help facilitate and shape our groups.<br></p>

<p>If you are aged <strong>18 or over</strong> and would like to work with a range of young trans people aged 10 - 25 in cities across England, read on to find out how to apply to become a Gendered Intelligence youth group volunteer.
Where could you volunteer?</p>

<p>We run youth groups in:</p>

<ul>
<li>London</li>
<li><a href="../trans-youth/Leeds.html">Leeds</a></li>
<li><a href="../trans-youth/Bristol.html">Bristol</a></li>
</ul>

<p>To volunteer, you should live in one of these cities or in short travelling distance to one of them.</p>

<p>We are in desperate need of volunteers for our Leeds group and BAME group in London.</p>

<p>In London, we run three groups: <a href="../trans-youth/11-15.html">Under 16</a>, <a href="http://genderedintelligence.co.uk/support-us/trans-youth/16-25">16-25</a> and <a href="../trans-youth/BAME.html">BAME (Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic)</a>.</p>

<h2>What are we looking for in a volunteer?</h2>

<p>Working with a large group of young trans people can be inspiring, but you will need to be committed to build up a good relationship with the group.  We would like to hear from people who are:</p>

<ul>
<li>reliable</li>
<li>open to reflect on their attitudes and behaviour</li>
<li>able to work with other people in a group setting.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What will you gain from being a youth group volunteer?</h2>

<p>Being a youth group volunteer gives you the opportunity to:</p>

<ul>
<li>build confidence in meeting new people and speaking to groups</li>
<li>experience planning and facilitating workshops and other sessions</li>
<li>contribute to the lives of young trans people.</li>
</ul>

<p>You will also have the chance to volunteer at GI events and on our <a href="../trans-youth/camping.html">annual camping trip</a>.</p>

<h2>How can I apply? <br></h2>

<p>To apply, follow the step below: <br></p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Fill in our</strong> <a href="volunteer/form.html"><strong>application form</strong></a></li>

</p></li>
</ol>

<p>It's OK if you do not have experience of working with young people.</p>

<p>If you have any access needs or other needs, please let us know on the application form. We want all of our volunteers to feel happy and safe in their work. 
Useful information</p>

<p>Please check that you meet the criteria for becoming a volunteer before you apply. To apply to be a youth group volunteer at, you should be:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Aged 18 or over</strong></li>
<li><strong>Trans and/or non-binary identified</strong></li>
<li><strong>Able to travel to one of the youth groups</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>To volunteer for the <strong>BAME</strong> youth group, you should identify as <strong>BAME/a person of colour</strong>.</p>

<p>Youth group spaces are wheelchair accessible.</p>

<p>All vounteers will have to undergo a DBS check, organised by us.</p>

<p>The young people we work with demonstrate that being trans never means just one thing. We want to support all sorts of difference. We are looking for a diverse team of volunteers to support our youth work and are seeking applicants from Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) backgrounds and working class backgrounds. We do our best to reduce the barriers to volunteering with GI.</p>
