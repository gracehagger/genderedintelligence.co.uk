					<h2>Making a self-care plan</h2>

<p>It is important to learn how to combat your own mental distress whether it is depression or social anxiety or anything else by making note of what works for you.</p>

<p>What works for one person may not work for another. Of course you’re not going to know from the offset what is most useful so you have to try things out.</p>

<p>It’s always a good idea to stay open to solutions and to try things out. Once you can recognize strategies you can identify how to take care of yourself and put in place an effective self-care plan.</p>

<p>This is a list that we put together based on discussions with other young trans people. Not all of them will work for you. Some of these things even contradict others. But that’s okay.</p>

<p>If you have solutions and strategies that you want to share be sure to get in touch and we can add them to the list!</p>
