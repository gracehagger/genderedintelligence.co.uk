					<h2>Toilets</h2>

<p>Sometimes trans people who are transitioning at school or university are asked to use a disabled toilet rather than toilets designated for men or women. Equality Challenges Unit has issued the following guidance:</p>

<p><strong>"A trans person should have access to ‘men-only’ and ‘women-only’ areas according to
the gender in which they live permanently. It should be agreed with the individual the point at which the use of facilities such as changing rooms, shower rooms and toilets change from one sex to the other. It is not acceptable to restrict a trans person to usedisabled toilet facilities unless they are disabled."</strong></p>
