					<h2>Changing Your Documents</h2>

<p>Changing your documents isn't difficult but it is time consuming and you may have to pay fees. Generally, to change your documents you'll need:</p>

<p>•   Your deed poll or statutory declaration proving your legal name change</p>

<p>•   For some documents, a letter from a medical or health practitioner identifying you as a trans person. This has to have very specific language to be valid in some places. See this <a href="docs/docletter.html">health professional's template</a> for an example which you can suggest your health practitioner use.</p>

<p>•   For some documents, a copy of your passport or birth certificate as proof of identity.</p>

<h2>Changing Documents Checklist</h2>

<p>Below are documents you should consider changing when you have changed your name. Not all are necessary for you to change but we have provided information on how to do it for those who require it. You can change your name and gender on everything except your birth certificate and with the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) without a Gender Recognition Certificate. The DWP will allow you to change your name, but not your gender marker.</p>
