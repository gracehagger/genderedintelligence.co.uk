					<h2>Changing your name at the bank</h2>

<p>Changing your name at the bank is fairly simple - just go to the information point in your branch and state you need to change your name and title on your account. You will probably be taken aside for someone to review your documents and explain the next steps. You'll generally get a new card and cheque book sent to you in the post.</p>

<p>Documents required:</p>

<p>•   Copy of change of name document (deed poll or statutory declaration)</p>

<p>•   A doctor's letter is not required, but may help if there is resistance to give you the correct title.</p>

<p>There are no costs to changing your name and gender markers at your bank.</p>
