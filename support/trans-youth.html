<h2>Youth Groups</h2>

<p>Gendered Intelligence runs a range of youth groups in London and Leeds for young trans people, non-binary and questioning young people aged under 21*. We also run a peer-led support group in London for those aged 18-30.</p>

<p>*Young trans people aged 8 or over are welcome to attend our Under 16 group in London and our Saturday sessions in London. At the moment, our groups in Leeds are open for young people aged 13-20. If you are a young trans person under the age of 13 and would like to come along to the group, please <a href="../contact/email.html">get in touch</a>.</p>

<p>No matter how you identify, Gendered Intelligence's trans youth groups are <strong>open to all young trans people</strong> - whether  you're brand new to identifying as trans, still questioning your identity, or if you consider yourself to be post-transition or as having a trans history. We strive to be fully inclusive of individuals who identify as non-binary / other, as well as male or female.</p>

<p><a href="../projects/kip.html"><strong>Knowledge is Power</strong></a> is a new on-line resource from Gendered Intelligence for young trans and gender variant people, their families and those who support them.</p>

<p>Over a 12 month period, we gathered information and experiences from young trans, gender variant and questioning people through a series of youth sessions. We also assembled research and writing from a diverse team of Gendered Intelligence community members.</p>

<p>Our Knowledge is Power project will provide you with lots of information, but it’s up to you to convert that into knowledge.</p>

<p>Knowledge is Power is a Big Lottery funded project.</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>Since 2010, we've taken young trans people on a weekend camping trip: an annual opportunity to take part in lots of fun activities and spend time with other young trans people. This is open to young trans people from the age of 11 – 25 years. <a href="../trans-youth/camping.html">Read more</a>.</p>
