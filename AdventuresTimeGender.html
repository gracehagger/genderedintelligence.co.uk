<p><a href="http://adventuresintimeandgender.org">Adventures in Time and Gender (2019-2020)</a> is a drama podcast written by Jason Barker and directed by Krishna Istha in collaboration with a group of young people from Gendered Intelligence.</p>

<p>Building on the success of the Transvengers project (2014-2015) and working in collaboration with researchers from the University of Exeter's Wellcome Trust-funded Rethinking Sexology team, young people investigated Western trans history and the history of Western European sexology.</p>

<p>From 2019 to 2020, as part of the Wellcome Trust-funded Transformations project, young people explored historical materials in a series of workshops, collected oral histories from older trans and non-binary people and participated in writers’ room meetings to develop ideas and characters for the podcast.</p>

<p>The evaluation from this stage of the project has demonstrated the value of historical and creative approaches for young people’s wellbeing and life chances. Jason Barker drew on this material when writing the script for the podcast, which was directed by Krishna Istha and performed by an all-star cast of trans and non-binary performers, artists, musicians and sound designers.</p>

<p>To enable podcast listeners to find out even more about trans history and the history of sexology, the team worked with They Them Studio to develop a brand new website, which hosted a range of creative responses and newly commissioned writing by trans and non-binary writers, artists and performers.
