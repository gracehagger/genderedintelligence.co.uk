<h2>Resources for Families</h2>

<p>Below are resources Gendered Intelligence has produced for families of young trans people.</p>

<h2>Guide for Parents and Families of Young Trans People</h2>

<p>In conjunction with the LGBT Consortium, Gendered Intelligence has produced a booklet aimed at parents and families of young trans people. We hope that this might offer parents and family members some information about what it means to be trans, how it might feel as a parent or family member of a young trans person and most importantly a bit of advice with regards to going forward from here.</p>

<p><strong>The new updated version of this booklet for 2013 is now available!</strong></p>
