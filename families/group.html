<h2>Support groups for parents and carers</h2>

<p>Gendered Intelligence offers support for parents and carers of young trans, non-binary, gender diverse and questioning young people and children.</p>

<p>Our groups for parents and carers take place twice a month.</p>

<p>Coming to a group is a great opportunity to meet other parents and carers who understand your situation, share stories and advice and make friends. Our parents and carers group are facilitated by an experienced member of the GI team.</p>
